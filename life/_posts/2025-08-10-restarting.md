Recently finished "Algorithms to Live By" (Brian Christian and Tom Griffifths).

I thought that it was a pretty accessible read: technical computer science/mathematical/economics terms were explicated in ways that can be understood by laymen. The authors also provide many suggestions which are directly applicable to daily life. Personally, while some of these suggestions feel like reminders of concepts that I am already aware of, I find it interesting to understand them from a computing perspective.

Here are some of the ideas illustrated in the book that I find particularly interesting (in no particular order):
1. "The cultural practice of measuring status with quantifiable metrics (such as age, wealth, height, military rank, etc.) ... might be an important factor that makes large-scale human societies possible - the existence of any benchmark at all transforms... the question of status from one that involves... tussles into something with a single reference point that ranks all" 
    - This is interesting because it seems that people, including me, sometimes like to grumble about how competitive society is and how we would like to "escape the rat race"; but perhaps it is the existence of such a "race" that enables the structure of our society so that we can live and interact non-violently with one another. Granted, there could be an alternative organisation of society allows us more time to pursue the things we like and cultivate more non-professional or non-work interests   
2. We might think that cognitive decline, or the slowness of thought, is something that comes naturally with age. But the slowness in remembering things or increase in the time required to think through things could simply be a result of our experience and accumulation of a large amount of knowledge through the years - we are not really experiencing "brain farts" as much as we are experiencing "cache misses"
3. Reminder: prioritise our tasks in the order of importance per unit of time. 
4. "Sometimes that which matters most cannot be done until that which matters least is finished"
5. "The tactical dropping of balls is a critical part of getting things done under overload"
6. "Actions are not beliefs"
7. "One of the chief goals of design ought to be protecting people from unnecessary tension, friction, and mental labor."

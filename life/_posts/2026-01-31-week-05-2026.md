# Second week of new job
I feel like I am more used to the workflows and the people, and there is still a lot to learn. There was a team dinner on Thursday and I sat with colleagues that I don't usually interact with in the office. I felt a nice sense of community (?) in getting to know them better.

This week I learnt (in no order of importance):
- how to book transactions related to corporate actions
- prioritizing checks for sign-offs
- how I can use an internal tool for CA elections
- working with the custodian bank on clarifications on CAs
- cleansing CAs, in particular U.S. DVOPs, and tenders

# Other
- Finally fully recovered from the cold that I caught last week
- Pushed myself to do 8x400m repeats
- Chugging along with War & Peace 
  - I haven't read many novels, but I think the way Tolstoy describes scenes, characters, and the inner life/thoughts of characters is unique
  - I feel like reading Tolstoy and similar writing can help in articulating one's thoughts and feelings, and to better empathise with other people
- Got back to doing my longer 10km-ish run this morning - beautiful weather and comfort food afterward; I can't appreciate mornings like this enough

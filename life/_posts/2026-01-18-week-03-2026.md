# Updates since the last time
- Today is my last day as data engineer as HSP - I have learnt a lot and am grateful for the time spent working with my colleagues:
    1. I've learnt what it means to be a senior engineer; it means being able to prioritize and plan, or make steps toward prioritizng and planning
    2. It means setting expectations and estimate the effort required to complete work such that the team is not over-extended nor too lax
    3. It means being able to communicate and work with people across different teams
    4. It means being patient
    5. It means knowing when to build incrementally and to know when specific things have to be conducted in a certain way (e.g. data governance)
    6. It means getting things done
- It wasn't an easy decision, and I spent ~2 weeks deliberating on it (I have documented the framework used in making decision elsewhere)
- Tomorrow, I will start a new job in a different domain (asset management operations). I don't know what it will bring, and I will do my best to:
    - be like an senior engineer
    - be [agentic](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/how-to-be-more-agentic)

# Exploring different planes
Beyond how I've made my decision to switch jobs, part of me wants to see this decision as 'exploring a different plane', in the sense of [Euan Ong - escaping flatland](https://space.ong.ac/escaping-flatland). Paraphrasing Euan, there are a lot more (job/life) options available to us than those that are marketed to us; and it's okay to take time to take on these options and figure out what is meaningful for us

Relatedly and from the aforementioned post, there are a lot of people that have vested interests in our career choices. Therefore, it's important to question people's motives for selling us on a choice and our own intentions for buying into a narrative. (See also [Caveat Vendor](https://rottenandgood.substack.com/p/caveat-vendor?r=51mrw&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true) by Rafe Meager - "It is too easy to become what other people have a use for")

I think I am over-exaggerating; it's not like I am making a radical choice that has a high probability of stepping off the train toward a comfortable "middle-class" life. So, it is not exactly [non-trivial](https://x.com/alz_zyd_/status/1923948247631978863). But I still see it as a risk.

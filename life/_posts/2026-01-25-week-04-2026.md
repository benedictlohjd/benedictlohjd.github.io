# First week in a new job
Just completed my first week in the new job a couple of days ago. Everyone is welcoming and encouraging, and I appreciate that. On my part, I am getting to know my team and the other teams, understanding the operational work that I have to do, and doing my best to absorb all the information. 

Importantly, I can improve my workflow to allow myself more time to think through the decisions that I am making at work, and to document/write things down as much as possible as I am working on them. No one at work is applying pressure on me, and I don't need to.

The past week, I've learnt about (not in any particular order and non-exhaustive):
- CAM, transactions, reconciliation modules on SCD
- Using Bloomberg
- Electing an option on a corporate action event
  - Including choosing between two currencies to receive dividends, and
  - Confirming an option with PMs
- SWIFT messages and message codes
- Spanish rights; and A & B events
- Checks: duplicate transactions, NAV impact, incomplete processing status, missing transactions, comparing data against vendors (Markit, Bloomberg)
- Accounting/portfolio performance attribution
- Claude/claude code


# Other related thoughts
In making the decision to switch jobs (into a new domain and scope of work), I've also relied on [The lazy person's guide to success](https://doglikeswalk.wordpress.com/2024/03/19/the-lazy-persons-guide-to-success/). I've tried to determine the traits for which I have a comparative advantage, and the types of work which would be well-suited to these traits. I haven't reached any definitive conclusion yet, but I am inclined to think a trait like this would be patience; having the patience to read and get stuck in on a problem.
